## My way of organising myself

Keeping track of tasks, prioritising and scheduling effectively is a big challenge. 

People are quite different and need different things in a task tracker, I value being able to schedule in tasks for later, having a record of what tasks got done when and being able to sort through the days tasks at the start.

That is why after lots of tweaking I have settled on my very own way I use [favro](https://favro.com) which is basically Trello++ (it is worth checking out). I have a board for each week of work, and at the start of each day I set myself goals and stretch goals for that day as well as any scheduled tasks I might have. I then do one at a time, using the [pomodoro](http://cirillocompany.de/pages/pomodoro-technique/) technique where practical. The current task sits in the Doing column then when it is done it moves into the column for the day.
